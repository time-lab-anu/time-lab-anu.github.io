    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The  ACM Web Conference (formerly the International World Wide Web Conference, or WWW) has been the leading annual venue for exploring the future of the World Wide Web since its inception in 1989. As the premier forum for presenting advances in Web technologies, the conference brings together researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and users to discuss and shape the Web’s future direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has introduced some of the most fundamental Web innovations, such as the Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 (prefiguring Google), the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003, and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. The conference continues to foster collaboration and innovation across academia and industry, addressing cutting-edge research, applications, and societal impacts of the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www2025.thewebconf.org/">2025 ACM Web Conference</a> will be held in Sydney, Australia, offering a hybrid format with both in-person sessions and rich virtual components. The program will include keynotes, research presentations, panels, workshops, tutorials, and opportunities for developers and junior scholars to engage with the Web community. Live streaming and pre-recorded talks will ensure global accessibility, while the Whova platform will facilitate interactive networking among participants worldwide.
    </p>


    <h2>TIME 2025 at WWW</h2>
    <p>
        TIME 2025 at WWW emphasizes the dynamic interplay of technology, innovation, and multidisciplinary exploration. The relevance of this workshop has never been greater, as web technologies increasingly influence sectors as varied as social media, healthcare, and e-commerce, each of which faces unique yet overlapping challenges. For example, privacy practices developed in healthcare can inform data security methods in social networks, while fairness in content moderation for social media can inspire transparency standards for e-commerce algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The workshop’s collaborative structure provides a timely response to these challenges, enabling researchers, practitioners, and domain experts to work together on practical guidance, comprehensive evaluations, and cutting-edge methodologies. This approach not only fosters the development of robust, responsible web technologies but also builds an accessible knowledge base that aligns with The Web Conference’s mission of promoting ethical, transparent, and secure principles in the web’s ongoing evolution.
    </p>

    <h2>TIME Lab at WWW</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://time.anu.edu.au/"> TIME Lab</a> at WWW, based at the Australian National University (ANU) and led by Dr. Lei Wang. Comprising master’s and honours students, as well as early-career researchers, the lab serves as a platform for collaboration, innovation, and mentorship, enabling members to tackle real-world challenges through cutting-edge research.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lab's research encompasses a broad spectrum of domains, including safety, security, smart cities, IoT, agribusiness, and defence, with practical applications in health and emerging industries. Students and early-career researchers actively contribute by designing and implementing real-time analysis frameworks and efficient video processing techniques, which aim to improve performance, safety, and innovation in these critical areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        TIME Lab fosters a culture of curiosity, collaboration, and excellence, where students and researchers are encouraged to develop impactful solutions and contribute to the broader Web community. By participating in projects at the intersection of academia and industry, team members not only gain invaluable experience but also push the boundaries of knowledge in Web research and its applications.

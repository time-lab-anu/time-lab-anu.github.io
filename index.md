#### Time is the key to understanding the movements and rhythms of everyday life. 

#### By watching how things happen over time, you can see the patterns and routines that shape our world. 

#### From the flow of traffic to the changing seasons to the way people interact, time reveals the details that help us make sense of everything around us.

We study the movements and activities captured in everyday videos. By looking closely at how things move and change over time, we aim to understand the patterns and rhythms of daily life. Our goal is to uncover how time influences everything around us, from how people interact to how the environment changes.
